Play app for finding GeoJSON data for geographic areas
======================================================

1. Enter a search term, e.g. "Berlin" and click "find" button. A result table with all matches to the entered query term will appear.

2. Choose row and click link under Area-ID to receice the GeoJSON of the chosen area. Note: N/A indicates that this is not a OSM relation with a valid area-id.

TODOs:

1. provide proper download for GeoJSON instead of copy/paste

2. display a map with chosen geoJSON data

3. improve UI (e.g. filter out N/As, highlight clicked row)
